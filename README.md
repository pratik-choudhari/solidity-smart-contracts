Keeping track of my progress in smart contracts with solidity

A smart contract leverages the block chain technology and adds a layer to act on events. A wide spread use of smart contracts is in NFTs, they help in transfering the assets and verify their ownership. Smart contracts can be triggered based on real-time and real-life events using oracles like chainlink.

Having learned four programming languages, I was able to quickly grasp solidity syntax. There are many video and text tutorials on the internet to learn smart contracts from.
